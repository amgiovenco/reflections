I stumbled upon this site when I was doing assignment 3 and trying to figure out 
how to make a Voronoi Treemap. I really liked the still photo background as you 
navigated through the site. When you scroll, the first thing you see is a decision 
tree. There are categories are numeric, categoric, numerical and categorical, maps, 
network, and time series. The map is interactive and it has different sections to
help you decide which type of graph you need to use. I’m thinking of using this for 
our final project. After the decision map, there is an overview of all the graph types, 
sorted by type and categorized by different colors. There was a caveat section the 
further you scroll, to help users avoid common mistakes. I really liked this section 
because it’s very vast and categorized by type of graph as well.
