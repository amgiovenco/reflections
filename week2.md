This visualization is one made by NASA for space exploration and asteroid tracking. You can see 
real-time positions of asteroids in our solar system. I was able to figure out how to use it right 
away due to its sleek and user-friendly design. There is a different color for each planets’ orbit 
and all of the asteroids’ trajectories are gray.  It is also a 3 dimensional visualization, allowing 
you to zoom in and out (all the way to Neptune!) to explore other celestial entities. I think the 
feature that stands out the most would be the real-time feed. Eyes on Asteroids provides up to
date information on the positions and trajectories of asteroids. This makes the visualization 
informative and relevant to current events, allowing users to track hazardous asteroids and see 
the projected paths over time. After messing around with it for a bit, I’ve learned a little more of 
what you can do with this. For each asteroid, there is a 3D model, discovery data and how it was 
discovered, size, distance from earth, and velocity stats for it.
