This is multiple different representations of animal welfare from 1961 to 2021 
in varying countries of the world. You can choose different metrics such as Animals 
Slaughtered, Live Animals (stocks), Cage and Cage Free Hens, Bans of Chick Culling, 
Bullfighting, and Fur Farming. You can also choose which specific animal you want to 
see data on (thereâ€™s 10+ options). There is also an option to see a per person metric 
as well. On the side, there is a list of the countries you can choose from. I personally 
liked the line chart with all the different colors, but there was also a world map option 
and a table option.
