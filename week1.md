I had no idea so many different fields used data visualization as the main discipline. 
Bioinformatics uses DataVis to transform data and analyze the outcomes of that data into insight. DataVis aims to amplify human intelligence, according to Sean I. O'Donoghue on Grand 
Challenges in Bioinformatics Data Visualization. I agree with this statement, if data visualization is the process of reanalyzing known data into something tangible, then it would provide more 
insight to said data. What I really want to address is his question he poses in this paper, “...of all our colleagues working across different life sciences, whose intelligence most needs amplifying? Or, humor aside, which 
fields are creating data that are both important and urgently need improvements in visual analysis?” (O’Donoghue). In my opinion, it would be biological and biomedical sciences. 
After the pandemic, I think medical and biological sciences are the most in need and most urgent department in line for updated data visualization technology, even if it isn’t only for Covid-19. 
There are plenty of other uncured diseases, such as HIV. In which, O’Donoghue goes on to agree with. In cell biology, there have been many new experimental techniques and computational methods that are working towards 
determining space taken up and organization of a human cell at the molecular level (I had to look up a lot of words in this paper, as O’Donoghue did not use the term “space taken up”, do you know what spatiotemporal 
means off the top of your head?). He goes on to explain that if updated datavis technology and methodology can meet their challenges, it would provide a framework for understanding the behavior of cells molecularly 
and create the same impact as DNA structure created.
