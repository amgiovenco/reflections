This is the Charctic Interactive Sea Ice Graph by the NSIDC (National Snow and Ice Data Center). It plots the sea ice extent, measured in millions of 
square kilometers, against the dates starting at January 1 to December 31. The graph has a feature to toggle the visibility of individual years, allowing users 
to make year-to-year comparisons or focus on specific years of interest. The "Show all years" checkbox lets you view all the data among the years they have. 
The "Show all years" checkbox lets you view all the data among the years they have. There are options to customize the graph's appearance, such as changing the start 
month, colors, and whether vertical gridlines are shown. The gray area shows the “interdecile range”, that represents the range within which the middle 80% of the 
recorded sea ice extents are. The solid gray line represents the 1981-2010 median, providing a reference point for comparing other years to this 30-year period's 
median extent. The red dashed line marks the record minimum sea ice extent, indicating the lowest recorded sea ice coverage over the time series displayed. 
Something I really liked about this graph was that you can change the colors of everything.
