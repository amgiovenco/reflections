This is a sort of cartography-timeline mashup of stats to show the ancient wonders of the world. The map is the 
Mediterranean region. The ancient wonders are marked here with icons showing their locations and their latitude/longitude 
coordinates. I liked the gradient used in this infographic, lighter colors were used to represent higher altitudes and 
darker colors for the lower ones. There is an arch timeline that shows the relative ages of the wonders. The one on this 
infographic illustrates the lifespan of each wonder with a different colored arc. Each wonder is numbered and listed with 
its name, location, and date of construction. These details are provided in a clear, tabular manner at the top of the infographic. 
There's a horizontal bar that compares the distance required to visit all the wonders with the transatlantic distance between 
New York and London, providing a real-world context for the distances. Overall a very clean and modern design with a strict 
color palette for aesthetics.
